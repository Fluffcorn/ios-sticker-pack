Changes to WAStickers code for compatibility

Add @objc attribute to init, addSticker, sendToWhatsApp methods in StickerPack.swift so that these methods can be called from Objective C.

Commented out UIApplication open URL methods in Interoperability.swift because they do not compile in a MessagesExtension.

Set iOS App Store link in Interoperability.swift to this format http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1171532447.

Add #import "MessagesExtension-Swift.h" to MessagesViewController.m to access exposed @objc Swift methods. Command-Alt click on the filename in import statement to jump to definition and see the adapted Swift methods.
